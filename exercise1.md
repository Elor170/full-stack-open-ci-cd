In a full-stack application using TypeScript for both the Node.js backend and React frontend, a typical CI (Continuous Integration) pipeline involves three common steps: linting, testing, and building.

For **linting**, we typically use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), which integrates well with TypeScript via the `@typescript-eslint` parser. It helps catch syntax and style issues early in the pipeline. Prettier can also be used alongside ESLint for consistent formatting.

For **testing**, the most common tools are [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/react) for the frontend, and again Jest or [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) with [Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) for the backend, especially for integration or API endpoint testing.

For **building**, the backend can be compiled with the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`), while the frontend is typically built using tools like Vite or Webpack, with commands like `vite build` or `react-scripts build`.

Besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions, alternatives for setting up CI include **GitLab CI/CD**, **CircleCI**, **Travis CI**, and **Azure Pipelines**. These services offer similar pipelines with YAML-based configuration files.

Choosing between **self-hosted** and **cloud-based CI** depends on multiple factors like cost, security requirements, scalability, and team expertise. Self-hosting tools like Jenkins offer full control and privacy but require maintenance. Cloud-based options like GitHub Actions reduce overhead, scale easily, and are easier to configure — making them ideal for small to mid-sized teams.

To make a final decision, we would need to know about the team’s infrastructure experience, the security policies, budget constraints, and how often the pipeline needs to run.
